        Hey! I'm Jesus Andales, an entry-level web developer. 
        I started my IT career back in 2013 as a computer technician. I specialized on troubleshooting hardware, software, and networks in 5 years.                                  
    </div>               
    <div v-scrollanimation class="flex  mb-4 ">
        Fast forward to 2019, I decided to pursue my career in web development, I taught myself to program, especially in PHP programming.
